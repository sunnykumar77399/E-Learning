# Online E-learning Platform

An interactive and comprehensive online e-learning platform designed to facilitate remote education. This project connects students, teachers, and administrators in a seamless digital learning environment. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the front-end, and **PHP with a MySQL database** for the back-end. The platform is designed to run on a local server environment like XAMPP.

The system supports three distinct user roles:
* **🧑‍💼 Admin:** Oversees the entire platform, managing users and content.
* **🧑‍🏫 Teacher:** Manages courses, uploads materials, and interacts with enrolled students.
* **🧑‍🎓 Student:** Enrolls in courses, accesses learning materials, and tracks their progress.
